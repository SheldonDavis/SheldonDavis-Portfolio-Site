<meta name="description" content="I am Sheldon Davis and this is my portfolio website. This site is intended for anyone to see and view my skill set as a Web Developer. I am a developer who codes, designs, and creates fully functioning and responsive websites. I have received my Associate in Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies with a concentration in Web and Interactive Design at Pittsburgh Technical College (Formerly Pittsburgh Technical Institute). Please take some time to review my portfolio of work on this site. The projects show my abilities with both front and back end development. My areas of concentration include the languages HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, and I have extensive training in the Adobe Creative Suite. I also have a fluent knowledge of the JQuery libraries and the implementation, customization, and use of JQuery plug-ins. I perform well working alone or in groups, and have experience being in lead positions while making difficult design and coding decisions. After working under a Creative Director and design team, I am very capable of transforming a predetermined design layout into a fully functioning website. I feel that the skills I have obtained during my time at Pittsburgh Technical College and the skills I have honed in the field have elevated me a level above the average web designer or developer.">

			<h1>Hello & Welcome</h1>
	
			<p class="ProfileIcon"><img src="/img/profile.jpg"/></p>
			
			<h3>My name is Sheldon Davis and I am a Father, Husband, and FullStack Developer.</h3>

			<p>In 2015, I graduated from Pittsburgh Technical College (formerly Pittsburgh Technical Institute) with an Associate of Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies with a concentration in Web and Interactive Design. While there, I learned and coded primarily with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. I also was provided with, and taught extensively, the use of the Adobe Creative Suite.</p>

			<p>Immediately following graduation, I started my career working for the design firm, PVA Interactive, where I focused on developing unique, creative, and responsive websites for clientele. Here, I expanded my understanding of both front and back end development, primarily within the WordPress Content management system, creating custom WordPress themes and plug-in customizations. At this time, I also gained a fluent knowledge of the jQuery library and the implementation, customization, and use of jQuery plug-ins.</p>
				
			<p>Within that year, I would meet my wife, and be married two years after that. It is here where I decide to make a change in my career.</p>

			<p>I obtained a position within Civil & Environmental Consultants, Inc. working on an internal company intranet. With this, I would learn and begin to develop with coding languages (Visual Basic, ASP and ASP.NET, some minor use of C#) and software similar to what I was familiar with but had never worked with before (SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio). </p>			

			<p>Roughly two years from then, my wife and I welcomed our son into the world and purchased our first home. Which leads us to the present, where I am still researching the latest technology and continuing to hone my skills within the industry. My latest intrigue, the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) code stack. Since starting my career journey, I have always had an interest in developing both web and mobile applications. The more I learn of the possibilities of using the MERN stack and the potential of React Native, the more my brain is flooded with possible projects that I can't wait to begin.</p>

			<p>I am proud to be a Father, Husband, and FullStack Developer.</p>
