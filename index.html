			<h1>Hello & Welcome</h1>
	
			<p class="ProfileIcon"><img src="/img/profile.jpg" alt="Sheldon Davis profile picture"/></p>
			
			<h3>I am Sheldon Davis, a Father, Husband, and Full-Stack Developer.</h3>

			<p>In 2015, I graduated from Pittsburgh Technical Institute with an Associate of Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies with a concentration in Web and Interactive Design. During my time there, I focused on coding with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, and received extensive training in the Adobe Creative Suite.</p>

			<p>Immediately after graduation, I began my career at the design firm PVA Interactive. There, I focused on developing unique, creative, and responsive websites for clients. I expanded my understanding of front-end and back-end development, primarily within the WordPress content management system, creating custom WordPress themes and plug-in customizations. During this period, I also gained proficiency in the jQuery library, including the implementation, customization, and use of its plug-ins.</p>
			
			<p>During that year, I met my wife, and we married two years later. This personal milestone prompted me to make a career change.</p>
			
			<p>I joined Civil & Environmental Consultants, Inc., working on an internal company intranet. In this role, I learned and began developing with Visual Basic, ASP, ASP.NET, and some C#, as well as software such as SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio.</p>
			
			<p>Approximately two years later, my wife and I welcomed our son and purchased our first home. After adjusting to my new routine and role as a father, I immersed myself in learning modern technologies, including React, Angular, NoSQL databases, TypeScript, and C#.</p>
			
			<p>Having gained a firm understanding of single-page web application development, I created my first full-stack web application, LemonWedge. After a few months of minor refinements, I considered it a significant milestone in my development journey. Soon after, I created the Sweet Surrender Ministry Center website pro bono for a relative seeking to expand their nonprofit's online presence.</p>
			
			<p>Currently, I continue to research the latest technologies and hone my skills in the industry. Throughout my career, I have maintained a strong interest in developing both web and mobile applications. The constant emergence of new technologies fuels my passion for exploring potential projects.</p>

			<p> In recent months, I have focused on upgrading this website and my portfolio projects. My current goal is to deepen my knowledge of Angular and C# to further demonstrate my skills and drive.</p>
			
			<p>I am proud to be a Father, Husband, and Full-Stack Developer.</p>
